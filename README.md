### The project involves utilizing the trip data from New York City Taxi Services, sourced from the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The dataset encompasses three main types of taxi services:

1. **Yellow Taxis:** Operate exclusively within the inner city, focusing on passenger pickups from this area.
2. **Green Taxis:** Designated for pickups in the outer boroughs, with the flexibility to drop passengers anywhere in the city.
3. **For-Hire Vehicles (FHV):** These include standard FHVs and High Volume For-Hire Vehicles (HVFHV), with the latter defined by companies completing over 10,000 trips daily. HVFHV are distinguished due to unique data reporting requirements and driver pay arrangements.

Collectively, these services account for approximately 1 million trips daily. The TLC makes this extensive data publicly available for various uses, including city planning and academic research, with notable utilization by corporations such as Microsoft and Amazon for demonstration and training purposes.

The dataset, accessible via a provided URL**https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page**, spans records from 2009 to present, updated biannually. It includes:

- **Trip Record Data:** Detailed from 2009, with yellow taxi data available throughout the entire period. Green taxis and standard FHVs were introduced in 2013 and 2015, respectively, while HVFHV began reporting in 2019.
- **Data Dictionaries and Metadata:** Offers insights into the data structure, including descriptions of columns for each taxi type.
- **Lookup Tables:** Contain additional information such as taxi zones, enhancing data comprehensibility.
- **Map Files:** For geographical plotting of data.

Furthermore, the 2020 Factbook(attached in the github) presents an in-depth look at taxi types, vehicle specifics, and trip frequencies. For the course, a selection of green taxi data throughout 2023 (January to December) is provided to facilitate manageable and cost-effective learning experiences.
